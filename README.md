# Preparation for the WCC exam

Because the PDF files are allowed during the exam, here is a collection of `markdown` files that can be converted to PDF using `Markdown PDF`.

## Source

Because of the numerous sources of content on the `JavaScript` and `HTML` topics, I have decided to use the following sources:

- [Mozilla Where to Start?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
    - [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) | Done:
        1. Getting started with HTML
    - [JavaScript First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps) | Done:
        1. Nothing
